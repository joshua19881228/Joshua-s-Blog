# Joshua-s-Blog

I start up this repo to manage the code of my personal website [Joshua's Blog](http://joshua881228.webfactional.com), which is set up on [WebFaction](https://www.webfaction.com/) and implemented by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and several other packages.

In addition to manage my own code, viewers can also use this project to learn how to build a website using Django. I will write down the works that need to be done to use these code.

Finally, welcome to visit [Joshua's Blog](http://joshua881228.webfactional.com).
