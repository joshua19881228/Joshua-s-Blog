# Joshua-s-Blog

I start up this repo to manage the code of my personal website [Joshua's Blog](http://joshua881228.webfactional.com), which is set up on [WebFaction](https://www.webfaction.com/) and implemented by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and several other packages.

In addition to manage my own code, viewers can also use this project to learn how to build a website using Django. I will write down the works that need to be done to use these code.

Finally, welcome to visit [Joshua's Blog](http://joshua881228.webfactional.com).

## Environment

1. [Ubuntu 14.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/). Though Ubuntu 16.04 has been released for a while, I am still using an older LTS release. I am not sure the following instruction can work fine on Ubuntu 16.04.
2. [Apache 2.4](http://httpd.apache.org/). I chose Apache 2.4 because my deploy server is powered by Apache 2.4. The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows. 
3. [WSGI 1.5](http://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). WSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request.
4. [Django 1.7.1](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Hmm... I am still using an ancient version of Django. It is also because I wish I could have an exactly same developping environment with the deploy one. Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
